I have finished my postdoctoral position at Toulouse on the TOAST project. This position was a joint effort and an interesting collaboration between the ISAE/DMIA lab, The ONERA/DTIM lab and the UC-Berkeley/CHESS lab<!--more-->. The TOAST project was funded by the RTRA fundation.

During this position, I have investigated a new research area focusing on the simulation of distributed realtime and embedded (DRE) systems. This work was a great complement of my skills about the model-based development of safety-critical systems.

This year was very rewarding not only for my research but also about travels and meetings. I had the great opportunity to discover the south of France and Toulouse, to travel and to work at the UC-Berkeley of California, to discover the west of the United states of America and to meet awesome people such as Floriane, Chlo&eacute; Benjamin, Momo, Elie, Patricia, William, Charles, etc. I'm sorry to not cite every people here but I have a thought for you all.

I also would like to thanks Pr. Janette Cardoso, Pr. Pierre Siron, Claire Pagetti, Eric Noulard, Pr. Edward Lee, Patricia Derler and Christopher Brooks. It was a great experience to work with you !!!

I hope our paths will cross again but right now its time to take a few months of well-deserved holiday and to get back to Reunion Island to see my family.

After my holiday, maybe a new adventure will start at Paris... but this will be for a new episode...
