	Abstract = {AADL is a modeling language to design and analyze High-Integrity Distributed and Real-time systems. Embedded sub-languages published as AADL annexes extend an AADL model to enhance analysis. The behavior annex specifies the behavior of an AADL application model. Thus, an implantation of this annex allows to perform behavior analysis. In addition, as there are several AADL annexes, the implementation of generic mechanisms to support each one of them is challenging. The behavior annex is a valid candidate to illustrate these challenges by combining several sub-languages. In this paper we expose our experiment to support the behavior annex in the reference AADL tool set OSATE2. This one, supports the AADL version 2 by providing a front-end and a set of analysis plug-ins to analyze an AADL model.},
