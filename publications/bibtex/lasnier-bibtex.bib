The AADL Behavior Annex (AADL-BA) is an extension allowing the refinement of behavioral aspects described through an AADL architectural description. When implementing Distributed Real-time Embedded system (DRE), fault tolerance concerns are integrated by applying replication patterns. We considered a simplified design of the primary backup replication pattern as a running example to analyze the modeling capabilities of AADL and its annex. Our contribution lies in the identification of the drawbacks and benefits of this modeling language for accurate description of the synchronization mechanisms integrated in this example.},

	Abstract = {Despite numerous advances, building High-Integrity Embedded systems remains a complex task. They come with strong requirements to ensure safety, schedulability or security properties, one needs to combine multiple analysis to validate each of them. Model-Based Engineering is an accepted solution to address such complexity: analytical models are derived from an abstraction of the system to be built. Yet, ensuring that all abstractions are semantically consistent, remains an issue, e.g. when performing model checking for assessing safety, and then for schedulability using timed automata, and then when generating code. Complexity stems from the high-level view of the model compared to the low-level mechanisms used. In this paper, we present our approach based on AADL and its behavioral annex to refine iteratively an architecture description. Both application and runtime components are transformed into basic AADL constructs which have a strict counterpart in classical programming languages or patterns for verification. We detail the benefits of this process to enhance analysis and code generation. This work has been integrated to the AADL-tool support OSATE2.},

@inproceedings{lasnier2011b,
	Abstract = {AADL is a modeling language to design and analyze High-Integrity Distributed and Real-time systems. Embedded sub-languages published as AADL annexes extend an AADL model to enhance analysis. The behavior annex specifies the behavior of an AADL application model. Thus, an implantation of this annex allows to perform behavior analysis. In addition, as there are several AADL annexes, the implementation of generic mechanisms to support each one of them is challenging. The behavior annex is a valid candidate to illustrate these challenges by combining several sub-languages. In this paper we expose our experiment to support the behavior annex in the reference AADL tool set OSATE2. This one, supports the AADL version 2 by providing a front-end and a set of analysis plug-ins to analyze an AADL model.},
